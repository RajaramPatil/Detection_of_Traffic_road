# Detection_of_Traffic_road
I have created a project (Detection Of Traffic Road) using ML algorithms. It detects real time traffic and Gives signal to the driver. It is basically used for automated 
driver assistance systems.
First I used Descriptor(ORB) to extract fetures from dataset.
Then K-mean clustering classification technique is used to reduce the size of dataset into clusters.
then we classified clusters usiing six different classifiers.
